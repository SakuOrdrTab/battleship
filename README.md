<H1>Battleship game</H1>

Python script for one player "battleship" -game against computer. UI with console, no GUI.

<H2>Installation:</H2>
Only runs on python environment.

Copy to a folder and run with your favourite python IDE or from prompt:
`python battleship.py`

<H2>A few notes...</H2>
The rules of the game implemented:
- One carrier, two cruisers, three destroyers, four submarines
- The hits and misses are shown in the display
- You get a notification of sunk vessels

There are helper methods for testing and prototyping. You can use the same method as the ComputerPlayer uses for placing the ships, as this is very boring. Also, there is a function to test two computer players against one-another; 100 rounds should not take too long time, but make quite a long console print.

The submarines make the game extremely tedious; It takes about 100 bombings to find all the vessels! But it is what it is..
